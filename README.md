# Roguelike Starter-Kit for Indigo

A library for use with [Indigo](https://indigoengine.io/) to provide some terminal-like rendering functionality specifically for ASCII art style games, and roguelike games in particular.

An early version of this code was used to build the [follow along examples](https://github.com/davesmith00000/roguelike-tutorial) to the [Roguelike tutorials](http://rogueliketutorials.com/). I'm still using this library in my revised [Roguelike demo game](https://github.com/davesmith00000/roguelike).

> Please note that follow along tutorials will be upgraded to use this library at some point.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your Indigo based game project (alongside the usual indigo ones):

### sbt

`"io.indigoengine" %%% "roguelike-starterkit" % "0.4.0"`

### Mill

`ivy"io.indigoengine::roguelike-starterkit::0.4.0"`

## Usage

Everything can be accessed via this import:

```scala
import io.indigoengine.roguelike.starterkit.*
```

## Running the demo

Download the repo, `cd` into the demo directory and (assuming you have electron installed), run `sbt runGame`.

You can hit the space bar to switch between the rendering modes.

Please note that the `TerminalText` scene has two examples on it, first the standard component and then a second component that uses a custom shader.

## What this library is

If you want to build a roguelike game, then you need to be able to render something that looks like a terminal with ASCII art.

In Python, people use a library called [tcod](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The roguelike-starterkit is not a full implementation of tcod, but it provides some of the key functionality you will need in a purely functional form.

## What roguelikes are

[Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)'s are a type of game that get their name because they are ...wait for it ..._like_ an 80s game called _Rogue_!

They typically use ASCII art for graphics, generated levels / dungeons and feature things like perma-death.

## Indigo vs Roguelike's

A few people have asked about using Indigo for Roguelike game building over the years, and it has come up again in response to the annual [r/roguelikedev - RoguelikeDev Does The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o5x585/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/).

There are some specific challenges with regards to Indigo rendering the seemingly straightforward graphics of a roguelike that I won't go into here, but I've generally had to caution people that Indigo _might not be good at this..._

This library is an attempt to open up roguelikes to Indigo game builders by going some way towards solving some of the rendering issues and providing out-of-the-box support for a standard roguelike artwork format, namely the Dwarf Fortress tile sets.

## Finding artwork

One of the great things about roguelikes is that they're usually ASCII art, and there is a wealth of available art "packs" that were created for the well known roguelike, [Dwarf Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress).

**This is excellent news for programmers!**

You can go ahead and build a game and it will look ...exactly like all the other ones! The quality of your game will be judged on the strength of your ability to code up a world, not on your ability to draw trees and people. Perfect!

This starter pack takes a Dwarf Fortress image that looks like this:

![A dwarf fortress tile map](demo/assets/Anikki_square_10x10.png "A dwarf fortress tile map")

([There are lots more of them to choose from!](https://dwarffortresswiki.org/Tileset_repository))

The project then uses custom shaders that allow you to set the foreground and background colours to render your world based on any of the standard format tile sheets you can find / make.

> It appears the the only graphical requirements are that you can set the foreground and background colors. If this isn't true please raise any issue!

## ASCII Art Materials

Rendering ASCII art means setting three things:

1. The character
1. The foreground color (implemented as a tint to retain shading)
1. The background color (which overrides a "mask" color with another color value - the mask color is magenta by default)

### `TerminalText`

This is a material for use with Indigo's standard `Text` primitive. In addition to foreground and background `TerminalText` also supports a solid colour dropshadow.

Looks great but has a glaring problem: Changing colors mid-artwork (e.g. setting the text red and the border blue) is a pain, you need to use another `Text` instance and make them line up!

Great for pop-up menus, and monochrome sections of ASCII art, or maps that aren't too big. After that, a new strategy may be needed.

[Example](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/roguelike-starterkit/blob/main/demo/src/main/scala/demo/TerminalTextScene.scala)

### `TerminalMaterial`

This material is a near drop-in replacement for `TerminalText`. It does not support the drop shadow feature, but has a leaner implementation for performance sensitive contexts. Supposed to be used with the `TerminalEmulator`/`RogueTerminalEmulator`'s `toCloneTiles` method.

Additionally, `TerminalMaterial` will attempt to preserve tile colours. If you apply a foreground colour to a tile, it will only apply the tint to greyscale pixel values. This means you can have a tree with a brown trunk, but tint just the leaf colours to autumn reds, yellows, and greens.

## The `TerminalEmulator` and the `RogueTerminalEmulator`

The terminal emulators are the basis of the library, and provide a simple 'terminal-like' object you and interact with to represent grids of ASCII tiles. They come in two flavours, both of which have the same interface but behave differently:

1. The `TerminalEmulator` is the recommended default. It is safe and immutable and easy to use, perfect for getting started. The drawback of the `TerminalEmulator` is that is not very performant, and at some point you may find it necessary to start caching results.
2. The `RogueTerminalEmulator` is a more dangerous version of the `TerminalEmulator`! It is a mutable structure, and as such, much more performant. As with all mutable data types, it must be handled with more care. Generally speaking though, you should be able to use it as a drop in replacement for the `TerminalEmulator`.

### Rendering with `CloneTiles`

To render the contents of a `TerminalEmulator` or a `RogueTerminalEmulator` we need to output `CloneTiles`.

Performance will vary by scene complexity, specifically how many unique colour combinations you have in place. In other words, if all your tiles are identical, the scene will be boring but rendering quickly. If every tile is unique then rendering will be slow(er).

[Example](https://github.com/PurpleKingdomGames/roguelike-starterkit/blob/main/demo/src/main/scala/demo/TerminalEmulatorScene.scala)

## Extras

The starter kit also provides:

1. An implementation of Bresenham's Line algorithm, used in the tutorial for line of sight across a grid.
2. A very, very simplistic path finding algorithm (just enough for the roguelike-tutorials).

## Roguelike UI

Documentation to follow. The Roguelike Starterkit from 0.3.3 onwards includes a prototype UI system specifically for roguelikes. There is an example in the `UIScene` in the demo project in this repo.
